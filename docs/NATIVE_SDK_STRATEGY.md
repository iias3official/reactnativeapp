**Decision Document for AstroWisdom**
**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for integrating native SDKs (Agora, Razorpay, Firebase) into the AstroWisdom React Native application while maintaining development efficiency and future flexibility.

**DECISION: Use Expo Development Client + EAS Build**

---

## üéØ Native SDKs Required

### 1. **Agora SDK** (Voice/Video Calling)

- **Purpose**: Real-time voice and video consultations
- **Requires Native Modules**: Yes
- **Platform**: iOS & Android

### 2. **Razorpay Native SDK**

- **Purpose**: Payment processing
- **Requires Native Modules**: Yes (for better UX and features)
- **Platform**: iOS & Android

### 3. **Firebase SDK** (Auth & Messaging)

- **Purpose**: Authentication and push notifications
- **Requires Native Modules**: Yes
- **Platform**: iOS & Android

### 4. **React Native Firebase**

- **Purpose**: Integration layer for Firebase
- **Requires Native Modules**: Yes
- **Platform**: iOS & Android

---

## üîç Options Evaluated

### Option 1: Stay with Expo Go ‚ùå

**Pros:**

- Fastest development
- No build configuration
- Instant updates

**Cons:**

- Cannot use native modules (Agora, Razorpay native)
- Limited to Expo SDK modules only
- Not suitable for production with custom native code

**Verdict**: Not viable for our requirements

---

### Option 2: Eject to Bare React Native Workflow ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Pros:**

- Full control over native code
- Can use any native module
- No restrictions

**Cons:**

- Lose Expo's convenience features
- Must manage iOS/Android projects manually
- More complex build process
- Harder to maintain
- No Over-The-Air (OTA) updates

**Verdict**: Possible but not recommended (too much complexity)

---

### Option 3: Expo Development Client + EAS Build ‚úÖ

**Pros:**

- Keep most Expo benefits
- Can use custom native modules
- EAS Build handles native builds in the cloud
- Development Client allows local testing with native code
- Over-The-Air (OTA) updates still work for JS changes
- Simpler than bare workflow
- Official Expo recommendation for custom native code

**Cons:**

- Need EAS Build account (free tier available)
- Slightly longer build times
- Need development build for testing native features

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

---

## üìñ Chosen Strategy: Expo Development Client

### What is Expo Development Client?

A customizable version of Expo Go that includes your app's native code. It's like Expo Go, but built specifically for your app with all your custom native modules included.

### How It Works

1. **Development**:
   - Install config plugins for native modules in `app.json`
   - Run `eas build --profile development` to create development client
   - Install development client on your device/emulator
   - Run `npx expo start --dev-client` for hot reload development

2. **Production**:
   - Run `eas build --profile production` for app store builds
   - Deploy JS-only updates with `eas update` (no rebuild needed)

### Workflow Diagram

```
Development:
  Write Code ‚Üí Config Plugin (app.json) ‚Üí EAS Build ‚Üí Development Client ‚Üí Test

Production:
  Ready for Release ‚Üí EAS Build ‚Üí App Store/Play Store
                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí OTA Updates (JS only) ‚Üí Live Users
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Set Up EAS Build

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Configure project
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform android
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### Phase 2: Add Config Plugins

Update `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "@react-native-firebase/app",
      "@react-native-firebase/messaging",
      [
        "react-native-agora",
        {
          "appId": "your-agora-app-id"
        }
      ],
      "react-native-razorpay"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Install Native Dependencies

```bash
# Firebase
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/messaging

# Agora
npm install react-native-agora

# Razorpay
npm install react-native-razorpay
```

### Phase 4: Build and Test

```bash
# Build development client
eas build --profile development --platform all

# Start development server
npx expo start --dev-client
```

---

## üì± Testing Strategy

### Local Development

1. **Development Client on Physical Device**:
   - Install development build from EAS Build
   - Connect to same WiFi as dev machine
   - Run `npx expo start --dev-client`
   - Hot reload works as normal

2. **Simulator/Emulator**:
   - Download development build from EAS
   - Drag and drop to simulator
   - Same workflow as physical device

### Feature Branches

For features requiring new native code:

1. Create branch: `feature/native-<feature-name>`
2. Update config plugins if needed
3. Build new development client
4. Test thoroughly before merging
5. Document any native changes in PR

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Strategy

### EAS Build Profiles

Create `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Development builds (for testing)
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Preview builds (for stakeholder testing)
eas build --profile preview --platform all

# Production builds (for app stores)
eas build --profile production --platform all

# Deploy JS updates (no rebuild)
eas update --branch production
```

---

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Expo EAS Build Pricing

**Free Tier:**

- 30 builds/month (total across all platforms)
- Good for: Small teams, early development

**Production Plan ($99/month):**

- Unlimited builds
- Priority queue
- Needed for: Active development, frequent releases

**Recommendation**: Start with free tier, upgrade when hitting limits

---

## üìã Native Module Checklist

Before adding a native module:

- [ ] Check if Expo has a built-in alternative
- [ ] Verify module has Expo config plugin support
- [ ] If no plugin, check if community plugin exists
- [ ] Document the native dependency in `NATIVE_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- [ ] Update `app.json` plugins array
- [ ] Create new development build
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Update team documentation

---

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. **EAS Build Required**

Once native modules are added, you **cannot** use Expo Go. All developers must:

- Install development client build
- Use `npx expo start --dev-client` command

### 2. **Development Client Updates**

Development client must be rebuilt when:

- Adding new native modules
- Changing config plugins
- Updating plugin configuration
- Upgrading React Native version

### 3. **JavaScript-Only Updates**

OTA updates work for:

- JavaScript code changes
- Assets (images, fonts)
- App configuration (that doesn't require native rebuild)

OTA updates **don't work** for:

- Native module changes
- Config plugin updates
- Native code modifications

### 4. **Version Management**

- **App Version**: Increment for native changes
- **Update Version**: Increment for JS-only updates
- Use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

2. [ ] Create `eas.json` configuration
3. [ ] Build first development client
4. [ ] Test Agora SDK integration
5. [ ] Test Razorpay integration
6. [ ] Document team workflow
